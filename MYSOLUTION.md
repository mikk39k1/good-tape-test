### **Bad excuses (lol)**:
I enjoyed the challenge, although i am not completely satisfied with the result i came up with. I would have liked to use some more time to polish both the visuals and the code itself. Not that it should be a bad excuse, but i had my final exams monday the 20th, so i used some time up to the date to prepare for that and finished most of this solution tuesday the 21st after work...I don't intend it to be a bad excuse, just wanted to mention it.

### **First time using Remix**:
I still wanted to challenge myself even though i was pressed on time, and that is very typical of me, if i find something interesting, i love diving into it and try stuff out. I will probably not have done everything based on the best practices, but i love trying new things, failing alot, pulling my hair out, until i find a solution. That feeling of completion og success at least, is one of the best i think.

### **Side quests**:
I chose to work on the following side-quests.
- `5. Custom Feature`
- `1. Styling Challenge`
- `3. Implement Voice Output for the Jokes`

### **5. Custom Feature**:
I thought it would be fun to try and work with an AI that would be able to take a full conversation from the trascript text or a full sentence, and boil that down into one single word that incompases the theme of the sentence. So for example a user being able to say "Can you tell me a joke about a spider?" And then the AI would take that transcript and boil it down to the most important word in that sentence, and use that as a search term for the joke API.
